## FIDU

Take control of your digital identity and break free from Big Tech. The FIDU app empowers users to collect and securely store their personal data, define precise preferences for its usage, and serve it to applications and agents strictly on their terms.

## More about FIDU

https://firstdataunion.org/intro/site_1.html 

## What it is

This project aims to demonstrate a taste of FIDU’s dream, where all use of a user’s data can be collected, controlled, and managed by the user themselves via this application. This is the first step towards reclaiming our data from big tech. 

## What it does

The application will collect the user’s data via an extensible ecosystem of data collection tools in the “Data Collection Layer”, starting with our initial web browser plugin. These tools transmit collected data to the core FIDU App, which then orchestrates its storage using a set of configurable and extensible storage options. Furthermore, the main application provides a user interface to define and manage your data sharing and usage preferences. Finally, authorised "Application Layer" programs can access and utilise your data  according to these defined preferences.

## The Goal

Our ultimate goal is to empower users to collect and control a large portion of their digital footprint within this data union. Eventually, the richness and comprehensiveness of this user-managed data will incentivise tech companies to directly request data from the union, thereby granting users unparalleled control over what information is shared and for what purpose.

## Installation

Coming Soon: instructions on a local installation. 

## Usage

Coming Soon: Example guide of firing up browser plugin, setting preferences, collecting some data, and observing it. Windows/Unix usage differences.  

## What’s (currently) in the box

Around the core orchestration application, there are a small suite of collection/storage/processing options to demonstrate development in these layers. The idea is that these will be extended into larger suites of options/application with time, resulting in a diverse set of options.

## Integrations/APIs

Coming Soon

**Description/links to API docs (hoping to use proto + swagger to maybe auto-generate these). This is an important section. 

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Feel free to fork the repo and use a feature branch.
