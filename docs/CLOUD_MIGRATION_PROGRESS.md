## Technical Decisions Made

### Database Structure
- **Separate databases**: Conversations and API keys stored in separate SQLite databases
- **Schema compatibility**: Exact match with FIDU Vault database structure
- **File format**: SQLite binary files for efficient storage and sync

### API Limits Strategy
- **Start conservative**: Monitor usage carefully with 1,000 calls/day limit
- **User limits**: Implement per-user rate limiting
- **Optimization**: Smart sync frequency based on user activity
- **Future scaling**: Plan for alternative storage providers if needed

### Security Approach
- **OAuth 2.0**: Secure token-based authentication
- **App Data Folder**: Files stored in user's private Google Drive space
- **No local storage**: API keys kept only in browser memory
- **HTTPS only**: All API calls over secure connections

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/services/storage/database/BrowserSQLiteManager.ts`
- `src/services/storage/types.ts`
- `src/services/storage/adapters/LocalStorageAdapter.ts`

- `src/services/storage/UnifiedStorageService.ts`
- `src/services/storage/index.ts`

## Future Enhancement: Local File System Storage

### Overview
This feature will provide users with an optional local file system storage option, allowing them to read/write database files directly to/from their local computer using the File System Access API. This is targeted at Chrome/Edge users who want maximum control over their data location.

### Browser Support & Limitations
- **Supported**: Chrome, Edge, and other Chromium-based browsers
- **Not Supported**: Firefox, Safari (will show disabled UI with explanation)
- **Requirement**: HTTPS context and user gesture for file access

### Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1: File System Access Service
- [ ] **Create FileSystemStorageAdapter** (`src/services/storage/adapters/FileSystemStorageAdapter.ts`)
  - Implement StorageAdapter interface
  - Handle file picker interactions
  - Manage persistent directory permissions
  - Implement **direct file operations** for normal read/write operations
  - Implement **bulk in-memory processing** for sync operations only
  - Add error handling for file system operations

- [ ] **Create File System API Service** (`src/services/storage/filesystem/FileSystemService.ts`)
  - Wrap File System Access API calls
  - Handle permission requests and persistence
  - Manage directory handles and file operations
  - Provide browser compatibility detection
  - Support both direct file operations and bulk database export/import

#### Phase 2: Permission & Path Management
- [ ] **Implement persistent directory storage**
  - Store directory handle using IndexedDB for long-term persistence
  - Implement permission checking and renewal
  - Add fallback for when permissions are revoked
  - Handle browser restart scenarios

- [ ] **Create directory selection UI components**
  - Directory picker button component
  - Permission status indicator
  - Directory path display (sanitized)
  - Clear/reset directory option

#### Phase 3: Settings UI Integration
- [ ] **Add storage options to SettingsPage**
  - New section: "Data Storage Options"
  - Radio buttons for storage modes:
    - Local Browser Storage (current default)
    - Google Drive Sync (current cloud option)
    - Local File System (new option - disabled on unsupported browsers)
  - Browser compatibility warning for unsupported browsers
  - Directory selection interface for file system option

- [ ] **Create StorageModeSelector component** (`src/components/settings/StorageModeSelector.tsx`)
  - Handle storage mode switching
  - Show appropriate options based on browser support
  - Provide clear explanations for each mode
  - Handle migration between storage modes

#### Phase 4: Migration Features
- [ ] **Implement Local → Cloud Migration**
  - Load all local SQLite files into memory (bulk processing)
  - Use existing Google Drive sync mechanism to upload files
  - Leverage current CloudStorageAdapter sync infrastructure
  - Verify data integrity after migration
  - Option to clear local directory after successful migration

- [ ] **Implement Cloud → Local Migration**
  - Download SQLite files from Google Drive using existing sync mechanism
  - Write to user-selected local directory using direct file operations
  - Verify data integrity after migration
  - Option to keep or remove cloud copies

- [ ] **Create Migration Wizard** (`src/components/settings/StorageMigrationWizard.tsx`)
  - Step-by-step migration process
  - Progress indicators for bulk operations
  - Error handling and rollback options
  - Data integrity verification
  - Clear messaging about local vs cloud data handling

#### Phase 5: Enhanced File System Features
- [ ] **Add file monitoring capabilities**
  - Detect external changes to SQLite files
  - Warn users about concurrent access
  - Provide conflict resolution options

- [ ] **Implement backup/restore functionality**
  - Export database files to user-specified location
  - Import database files from user-selected files
  - Data validation and integrity checks

### Technical Considerations

#### File Operations Strategy
**Normal Operations (Direct File Access):**
```typescript
// Single conversation read/write - direct file operations
const fileHandle = await directoryHandle.getFileHandle('conversations.db');
const file = await fileHandle.getFile();
const data = await file.arrayBuffer();
// Process single conversation directly
```

**Sync Operations (Bulk In-Memory Processing):**
```typescript
// Migration/sync - bulk processing using existing infrastructure
const conversationsDb = await this.loadFullDatabaseToMemory();
const apiKeysDb = await this.loadFullDatabaseToMemory();
// Use existing CloudStorageAdapter sync mechanism
await this.cloudStorageAdapter.syncDatabases(conversationsDb, apiKeysDb);
```

#### File System Access API Usage
```typescript
// Example API usage patterns
const directoryHandle = await window.showDirectoryPicker();
const fileHandle = await directoryHandle.getFileHandle('conversations.db', { create: true });
const writable = await fileHandle.createWritable();
await writable.write(sqliteData);
await writable.close();
```

#### Permission Persistence Strategy
- Store directory handles in IndexedDB for long-term persistence
- Check permission status on app startup
- Gracefully handle revoked permissions
- Provide clear UI feedback about permission status

#### Error Handling Scenarios
- File system access denied
- Directory moved or deleted
- Insufficient disk space
- Concurrent access conflicts
- Browser compatibility issues
- Memory exhaustion during bulk operations
- File corruption during sync operations
- Network failures during cloud migration

#### Security Considerations
- Only access user-selected directories
- No system directory access
- Explicit user permission for each operation
- Secure handling of file paths and metadata

### User Experience Design

#### Settings Page Layout
```
Data Storage Options
├── Storage Mode Selection
│   ├── ○ Local Browser Storage (Default)
│   ├── ○ Google Drive Sync
│   └── ○ Local File System [Chrome/Edge Only]
├── Local File System Configuration (when selected)
│   ├── Selected Directory: /Users/username/Documents/FIDU-Data
│   ├── [Change Directory] button
│   ├── Permission Status: ✅ Active
│   └── [Clear Directory] button
└── Migration Options
    ├── [Export to Google Drive]
    └── [Import from Google Drive]
```

#### Browser Compatibility Handling
- Show clear warning for unsupported browsers
- Explain why the feature is unavailable
- Suggest alternative approaches (export/import)
- Provide links to supported browsers

### Implementation Priority
1. **High Priority**: Core FileSystemStorageAdapter and basic UI
2. **Medium Priority**: Permission persistence and migration features
3. **Low Priority**: Advanced monitoring and backup features

### Testing Strategy
- [ ] Test on Chrome/Edge with various directory permissions
- [ ] Test permission revocation scenarios
- [ ] Test browser restart and permission persistence
- [ ] Test migration between storage modes
- [ ] Test error handling for file system issues
- [ ] Test UI on unsupported browsers (Firefox/Safari)

### Success Criteria
- Users can select and persist local directory access
- SQLite files can be read/written to local directory
- Migration between storage modes works seamlessly
- Clear UI feedback for all browser compatibility scenarios
- Robust error handling for file system edge cases
