# Script to run the code quality checks for the FIDU Local App
# This script will run the black formatter, pylint, mypy, and pytest with coverage

# run with './scripts/lint.sh'
# After running the setup_dev.sh script, this script will be ran automatically as a pre-commit hook

# Currently this script will exit on any error, which will cancel the pre-commit hook. 
# Could be a good space to work on, to allow the pre-commit hook to continue even if there are certain errors
# or warnings present, so the linter is less of a pain. 

# Exit on any error
