            Contexts are collections of information that you can create based on previous 
            conversations you've had with models, or wish to add from anywhere else. You can 
            add a context to a conversation so that the model will have access to this 
            information, and be able to answer your queries with ease.
          </Typography>
          
          <Typography variant="body1" paragraph sx={{ mb: 2 }}>
            For example, if you ask frequent questions about your car, you may have a context 
            that has a lot of specific information about your car (make, model, year, previous 
            issues it's had, etc.). Then when asking a new question about your car, add this 
            context to the chat, and the model will be able to reference this info without 
            asking you to clarify every time.
