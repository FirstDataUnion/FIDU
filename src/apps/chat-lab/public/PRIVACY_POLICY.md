# Privacy Policy for FIDU Chat Lab

**Effective Date:** 9 October 2025

## 1. Introduction

FIDU Chat Lab is a data-control-first conversational AI interface developed by First International Data Union (FIDU). This privacy policy explains how we collect, use, store, and protect your data when you use the Chat Lab application.

**Core Principles:**
- **Data Sovereignty:** You control where your data is stored
- **Transparency:** Clear disclosure of what data we collect and how we use it
- **Minimal Collection:** We only collect what's necessary for functionality and service improvement
- **No Third-Party Tracking:** We do not use advertising cookies or share your data with advertisers

## 2. Data We Collect

### 2.1. Account & Authentication Data

When you create an account or log in to FIDU Chat Lab, we collect:

- **Email address** (for account identification and login)
- **Name** (as provided during registration)
- **Profile information** (display names you create within the app)

**How we store this:**
- Account information is stored securely in our Identity Service database
- Authentication tokens are stored locally in your browser (memory, localStorage and cookies)
- Tokens are encrypted in transit using HTTPS/TLS

### 2.2. Conversation & Application Data

Your conversations and application data include:

- **Messages** (your prompts and AI model responses)
- **Contexts** (document snippets or information you provide for context)
- **Documents** (text you provide or generated by your background agents)
- **System prompts** (custom instructions you create)
- **Background agents** (custom instructions you create to be run periodically in your conversations)
- **API keys** (for AI service providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)
- **Application settings** (theme preferences, storage mode, etc.)

**How we store this:**
- **Google Drive Sync Mode**:
  - **Personal Workspace**: Your encrypted conversation data is stored in your personal Google Drive within the hidden AppData folder. The ChatLab app has access only to the FIDU folder in your AppData folder, and cannot read or write data anywhere else in your Google Drive. This access can be revoked at any time. Your personal encryption key is stored separately on our Identity server, and is always encrypted in transport via HTTPS and secured at rest via file system level encryption.
  - **Shared Workspace**: Your encrypted conversation data is stored in the person Google Drive of the workspace owner. The ChatLab app has access only to the files/folders the workspace owner granted access to, and cannot read or write to any other file in that Google Drive and has no access at all to the Google Drive of users invited to a Workspace (unless they have separate Workspaces themselves). This access can be revoked at any time. The workspace encryption key is stored separately on our Identity server, and is always encrypted in transport via HTTPS and secured at rest via file system level encryption.

### 2.3. Technical & Usage Data

We collect anonymous usage metrics to monitor system health and improve the service. These metrics do not include the content of your conversations or any personally identifiable information. 

For detailed information about what metrics we collect, how they are used, and how to opt out, see **Section 4: Anonymous Metrics Collection**. 

### 2.4. Google Drive Integration

If you enable Google Drive cloud storage, we use the Google Drive API to:

- Store your encrypted conversation database in your Drive
- Synchronize changes across devices

**Important:**
- We only request access to files that FIDU Chat Lab creates
- We cannot access other files in your Google Drive
- Your data is stored in **your** Google Drive account (or that of the Workspace owner), not on our servers
- You can revoke access at any time through Google Account settings

## 3. How We Use Cookies & Local Storage

**If You Are a Parent or Guardian:**
If you believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us at privacy@firstdataunion.org and we will delete the information immediately.

**Age Verification:**
By using Chat Lab, you confirm that you are at least 13 years old (or 16 in the UK/EEA), or have parental consent.

## 10. International Data Transfers

FIDU is based in the United Kingdom. However, your conversation data is stored in your personal Google Drive account (or that of the Workspace's owner in Shared Workspaces).

**Account Information:**
Your account information (name, email) is stored on FIDU servers located in the UK or EU. If you access Chat Lab from outside the UK, your account data will be transferred to and processed in the server's country under UK GDPR standards.

**No Cross-Border Data Sharing:**
We do not transfer or share your data with third parties outside the UK or EU, except:
- Google Drive (if you enable Google Drive Mode) - governed by Google's international data transfer policies
- AI service providers you connect to (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.) - governed by their own respective policies. 

**Safeguards:**
All data transfers are protected by HTTPS/TLS encryption and comply with UK GDPR requirements.

## 11. Cookie Consent

**Essential Cookies:**
FIDU Chat Lab uses only essential cookies required for the application to function. These cookies are necessary for:
- Authentication and session management
- Maintaining your security
- Core application functionality

**No Consent Required:**
Under UK and EU law, consent is not required for essential cookies. We do not use optional or non-essential cookies.

**Your Control:**
You can manage or delete essential cookies through your browser settings, but this will prevent you from using Chat Lab. See Section 3.3 for details on managing cookies.

## 12. Data Breach Notification

We take data security seriously and have implemented measures to protect against unauthorized access, loss, or disclosure of your data.

**In the Event of a Breach:**

If we experience a data breach affecting your account information, we will:

1. **Assess the Breach:** Determine the scope, severity, and data affected within 24 hours
2. **Notify Authorities:** Report to the UK Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) within 72 hours if required by law
3. **Notify You:** Contact you via email within 72 hours if your personal data is affected
4. **Provide Information:** Explain what data was compromised, what we're doing about it, and steps you can take to protect yourself
5. **Remediate:** Take immediate action to secure systems and prevent future breaches

**Limited Exposure:**
Because your conversation data is stored locally or in your Google Drive (not on our servers), most data breach scenarios would only affect account information (name, email), not your conversations or API keys.

**Your Responsibility:**
- Keep your password secure
- Monitor your account for suspicious activity
- Report any suspected unauthorized access to hello@firstdataunion.org
